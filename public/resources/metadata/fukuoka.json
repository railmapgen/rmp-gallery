Unlike most other public operators in Japan, the company only operates subways without any bus lines.\n\nFukuoka City Subway has 3 lines, Kūkō Line, Hakozaki Line, and Nanakuma Line.\n\nHakata and Nakasu-Kawabata stations are counted twice (as Kūkō-Nanakuma and Kūkō-Hakozaki interchanges, respectively). The total number of individual stations is therefore 36.\n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukuoka_City_Subway)"
