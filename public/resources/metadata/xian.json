        "en": "Xi'an Metro, the urban rail transit system of Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province, China, was established in September 2006 and is a part of the Xi'an urban rail transit system. Its first line (Xi'an Metro Line 2) was opened for trial operation in September 2011, making Xi'an the first city in Northwest China to operate a metro system and the 14th city in Chinese Mainland to do so. Its operation network has extended to the neighboring city of Xianyang. As of December 2024, Xi'an Metro has a total of 11 lines in operation, namely: Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 4, Line 5, Line 6, Line 8 (loop), Line 9, Line 10, Line 14, Line 15, and Line 16, all utilizing the metro system with a total operating mileage of 403 kilometers. Additionally, it operates the Xihu Line, a regional railway line, using a railway system. There are a total of 245 stations (excluding transfer stations), including 37 transfer stations. On December 31, 2024, Xi'an Metro's passenger flow reached a new record high, safely transporting 5.539 million passengers. Xi'an Metro's daily passenger volume exceeded the \"5 million mark\" for the first time. As Xi'an is the ancient capital of thirteen dynasties in China, it has abundant underground ancient remains, and metro construction often proceeds simultaneously with archaeological excavations. Xi'an Metro has a rigorous process specification for planning, exploration, excavation, and protection, ensuring the safety of cultural relics and the timely opening of the line.
