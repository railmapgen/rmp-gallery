        "en": "The Xi'an Metro is an urban rail transit system in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China. It was established in September 2006 and is a part of the city's urban rail transit system. Its first line (Xi'an Metro Line 2) was put into trial operation in September 2011, making Xi'an the first city in northwest China to operate a subway, and also the 14th city in Chinese Mainland to operate a subway. Its operation network has been extended to the adjacent Xianyang City. By December 2024, there are 11 lines of Xi'an Metro that have been put into operation, including Line 1, Line 2, Line 3, Line 4, Line 5, Line 6, Line 8, Line 9, Line 10, Line 14, and Line 16, all of which use the subway system, with a total operating mileage of 403 kilometers; Also operate the Xihu Line of the urban railway, using railway standards; There are a total of 235 stations (excluding double counting of transfer stations), including 34 transfer stations. On December 31, 2024, the passenger flow of the Xi'an subway network reached a new historical high, safely transporting 5.539 million citizen passengers. The daily passenger volume of the Xi'an subway exceeded the \"5 million mark\" for the first time\nDue to Xi'an being the ancient capital of thirteen dynasties in China, with abundant underground ancient relics, subway construction is often carried out simultaneously with archaeological excavations. The Xi'an Metro has a rigorous set of process standards for planning, exploration, excavation, and protection, ensuring the safety of cultural relics and the timely opening of the line.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an_Metro",
