The rail network extends 879 km (546 mi)[1] across 12 urban and suburban districts of Beijing and into one district of Langfang in neighboring Hebei province. Between December 2023 and December 2024, the Beijing Subway became the world's longest metro system by route length, surpassing the Shanghai Metro. The system has since returned to being the world's second longest, with new lines being opened by the Shanghai Metro. With 3.8484 billion trips delivered in 2018 (10.544 million trips per day[6]) and single-day ridership record of 13.7538 million set on July 12, 2019, the Beijing Subway was the world's busiest metro system in the years immediately prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Subway"
