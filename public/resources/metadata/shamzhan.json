        "en": "By the end of 2024, Sham Zhan Metro added several new operational line sections. Phase 1 of Shek Ngam Line (13) from Sham Zhan Bay Port to Hi-Tech Central was opened. The western section of Sai Lai Line (7) was extended eastward from Sai Lai Wu to SZU Lai Wu Campus. Lung Kong Line (3) was successfully extended eastward from Sheung Lung to Ping Tei Luk Luen. Airport Express  (11) was also extended eastward from Kong Ha North to Wa Keung South, connecting with Sai Lai Line (Line 7). This map is redrawn based on the parts already drawn by Sham Zhan Metro at the end of 2024, adopting the graphic style of the MTR and following the original geographical scale as closely as possible."
